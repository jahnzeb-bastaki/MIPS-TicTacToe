everyone - has their own unique contributions to the overall program, such as (lines of code) 
         - shared ideas for the program's algorithm and procedures 
         - contributed through the use of github / added their own files for everyone's reference
         - checked and proofreaded each other's code 
         - Improved each other's ideas by eliminating or adding to the program 
         - we all created the program with our own algorithms and techniques then later on, merged
         and combined with the group
         - communicated through discord and github 
         
         
  a. Trisha - description of the program (Project report (1a)) 
            - github file (created own program for idea suggestion and reference) 
            -video about demonstration of the program
            - word file / reformatted and organized to be used as template
