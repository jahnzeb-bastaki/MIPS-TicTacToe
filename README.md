# MIPS Assembly Code: Tic Tac Toe
## Description
Welcome to our implementation of Tic Tic Toe using MIPS Assembly Language. In this implementation, we created a Tic Tac Toe game where the user of the application plays against a computer that randomly chooses the spot on the board. The user has the option of playing either the 'X' or the 'O' symbol. The game is determined to be over when the win condition is met or the game ends in a tie.

## Getting Started
To get started in running the application, first ensure that you have a MIPS Assembly Environment set up on your local machine. If you do not have a MIPS Assembly Environment, you can download one here: [MIPS Assembly Environment](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm)

After that download the game onto your local machine, and run the file in the Environment and thats it!
